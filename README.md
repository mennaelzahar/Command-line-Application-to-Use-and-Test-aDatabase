# Command-line-Application-to-Use-and-Test-a-Database
This peoject was created as part of the Database Systems course in Spring 2022. 
In this project, a database for the football league system Premier League found on www.premierleague.com was implemented using MySQL Workbench 
through web-scraping the website to get the data using Python. A command-line application was then implemented to test the database.
